# Detecting images with Tensorflow.js

## 1. About
This is a demonstration of image recognition by machine learning with Tensorflow.js. Pre-trained models are used, which are freely available:
- https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/mobilenet
- https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/coco-ssd

Image recognition takes place directly in the browser, no cloud-based AI is used.
Required libraries are integrated in this demo via CDN. Of course these libraries can also be integrated directly into the project to get offline capability.


## 2. Setup
1. 'npm install' to install http-server
2. 'http-server' to start http-server
3. Open your browser and go to:  http://localhost:8080
